The __FoodHygieneRatings__ project is written using SpringBoot and Thymeleaf.
<br>It contains two endpoints:
1. <http://localhost:8080/foodhygiene/authorities>
2. <http://localhost:8080/foodhygiene/authorities/{authorityId}/ratings>

<p>The first endpoint displays a list of all the local authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
(At the moment I only show the first twenty, to speed up the application - this will change in time)
<p>By clicking on the <i>View</i> link for an authority, you are redirected to the second endpoint, 
with the <i>authorityId</i> set to that of the authority you selected.
This endpont summarizes the food safety ratings achieved by the businesses within the authority.
Each rating category is shown, along with the percentage of premises that achieved that rating.
